# Clustering methods

Find groups (a.k.a) clusters in my data.

## K-means clustering

Make up some data to test with.

```{r}
# Make up some data with 2 clear groups
tmp <- c(rnorm(30, mean = 3), rnorm(30, mean = -3))
x <- cbind(tmp, rev(tmp))
plot(x)
```

The `kmeans()` function does k-means clustering.

```{r}
k <- kmeans(x, centers=4, nstart=20)
k
```

We can use the dollar syntax to get at the results (components of the returned list).

> Q2. What 'component' of your result object details 
      -cluster size?
      -cluster assignment/membership?
      -cluster center?

```{r}
k$size
k$cluster
k$centers
```

> Q3. Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and add cluster centers as blue points

```{r}
plot(x, col=k$cluster)
points(k$centers, col="blue", pch=15, cex=2)
```

## Hierarchical Clustering

The hclust() function needs a distance matrix as input not our original data. For this we use the `dist()` function.

```{r}
hc <- hclust(dist(x))
hc
```

```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=10, col="red")
```

To get our cluster membership vector we need to cut our tree and for this we use the `cutree()`

```{r}
cutree(hc, h=10)
```

You can cut by a given height h= or into a given number of k groups with k=

```{r}
cutree(hc, k=2)
```


# Principal Component Analysis

## PCA of UK food data

Let's read our data about the weird stuff folks from the UK eat and drink:

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <-  read.csv(url, row.names=1)
```

Look at the first bit of the file:

```{r}
head(x)
```

How many columns in this dataset:

```{r}
ncol(x)
```

We can make some plots to try to understand this data a bit more. For example barplots:

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x))
```

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside = TRUE)
```


# PCA to the rescue

The main base R function for PCA is called `prcomp()`

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(x))
summary(pca)
```

What is in this returned pca object?

```{r}
attributes(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=c("orange", "red", "blue", "green"), pch =15)
text(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], labels=colnames(x))
```

We can look at how the variables contribute to our new PCs by examining the pca$rotation component of our results.

```{r}
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2)
```


# PCA of RNA-seq data

Read the data first.

```{r}
url2 <- "https://tinyurl.com/expression-CSV"
rna.data <- read.csv(url2, row.names=1)
head(rna.data)
```

How many genes (how many rows)?

```{r}
nrow(rna.data)
```

How many experiments (how many columns)?

```{r}
ncol(rna.data)
```

Let's do PCA of this dataset. First take the transpose as that is what the `prcomp()` function wants.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(t(rna.data), scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

We can make our score plot (a.k.a. PCA plot) from the `pca$x`.

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2])
```

Make a little color vector to color up our plot by WT and KO

```{r}
colvec <- c(rep("red", 5), rep("blue", 5))
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=colvec, pch=15)
text(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], labels=colnames(rna.data))
```
